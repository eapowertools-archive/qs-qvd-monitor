# qs-qvd-monitor
 QVD Monitor Dashboard for Qlik Sense deployments

The **qs-qvd-monitor** application is an application supported by the Americas Enterprise Architecture team from Qlik. It is a Qlik Sense dashboard (.QVF file) that loads metadata about your QVD files.  The application uses existing data connections for your QVD files as the inputs, along with a folder to write historical metadata to (which you provide in the data load script).  This means there is no installer and it is plug and play, assuming you have rights and access to the data connections. Complete setup instructions can be found in the script.

\*_Note that this application was designed for use alongside the Qlik Sense Admin Playbook (https://adminplaybook.qlik-poc.com/)._
